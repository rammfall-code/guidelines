## Pipeline. A pipeline is a sequence of automated steps that run code checks. It is triggered in GitHub after code is pushed. The pipeline can have three statuses: pending (checks are in progress), failed (checks did not pass due to issues like incorrect code, errors, or failed tests), and passed (all checks were successful).
